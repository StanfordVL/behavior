# Baselines

We provide a set of common baselines from the Robot Learning literature to help creating a developing new solutions for BEHAVIOR.
Our baselines include imitation learning and reinforcement learning, both in the original low-level action space of the benchmark, and making use of our provided set of action primitives based on sampling-based motion planning.
Here, we briefly describe the baselines you can find in this repository.

#### Imitation Learning Baseline

#### Reinforcement Learning Baseline in the Original Action Space

#### Reinforcement Learning Baseline with Action Primitives
